  "description" : "Welcome to my very first serious mod, Chaos Weapons!\n\nIt's a mod that adds a collection of crazy powerful weapons with neat mechanics, but there is a fair share of odd items waiting to be discovered. Each weapon has a powerful attribute or ability to their name. The most annoying possible thing could be that each weapon is part of a recipe for another weapon, making it a tiered crafting tree.\n\nEither way, I had loads of fun making this mod, and learned new things as well!\n\nThis mod will be updated once I herald new ideas and a new mechanic.",
